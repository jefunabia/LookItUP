- To provide important information when travelling.

## Interactive Map
**LookItUP** uses Google Maps API for all the main features.

Dragging around the map can help users to learn more about the surroundings.

Users can also zoom in or zoom out the map to see all the landmarks and labels in their desired location.

**Google Street View** is also included so that users can have an actual visual representation of their desired location.

Thanks to **Google's Autocomplete service**, users won't need to type in completely their desired locations! 
        
## Never Get Lost Again!
Just simply enter a **Starting Point** and a **Destination Point** to see if there are any available public transportation vehicles that you can take to reach your desired destination!

After entering the points, the points will be marked and a route will be shown for travelling guidance.

Information of the available transportation vehicles will then be displayed, such as their: description, and cost.

Transporataion Services Applications are also displayed, including a link to their websites for further convenience.
